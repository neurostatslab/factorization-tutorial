The data can be downloaded at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u4FXmpNBwXQGTNs4jnouGrdpJgVttYiU?usp=sharing

Save them in the same folder as the code.

## <u>For Matlab users</u>: 

- make sure you have the **Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox** installed.

- You may write your code in:  *practical_session_questions.m*.
- practical_session_solutions.m* provides the example solutions.



## <u>For Python users</u>:

- You will need **jupiter-notebook**, **numpy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib** and **scikit-learn**.

- You may write your code in : *python_practical_session_questions.ipynb*

- There is no example solution in python.
